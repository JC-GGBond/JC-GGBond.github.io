I have some suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript for publication.

1. Mathematical design parameters of antenna and metasurface should be added to the manuscript.
   应该是想要参数设计公式
    
   **学习一下天线论文里单元结构长宽与电参数间的公式关系逻辑**
   按他们那格式加一个表
   Design Parameters and their values

2. Metasurface unit cell analysis should be added to the manuscript such as reflection phase properties.
   反射相位特性

   查一下引文TAP中反射相位和单元结构的写法。


3. Novelty and technical contributions should be included in the introduction.
   创新型写在intro里
4. The antenna hardware prototype should be presented in a separate figure.
   增加一张实物图片
5. XYZ plane should be presented in the figure. 1 or figure. 2 whereas the radiation pattern can also be represented as xz and yz plane for better understanding.
   XYZ平面图？辐射特性？
6. Figure.5 to 8 should be revised as variables are not visible.
   改图5到8的图片中单位，变大点
7. The author should provide the VNA name and gain measure methodology with the figure.
   提供测试仪器VNA名称和测量图
8. The author should provide the EM software tool, which is used to design the antenna and simulation.
   提供仿真软件
9.  Future work should be discussed in the conclusion section.
    后续未来工作

1. author need to do the analysis for unit cell.
