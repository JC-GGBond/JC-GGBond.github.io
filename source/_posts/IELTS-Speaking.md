## part 2
Do you think there are too many rules for children to follow, whether at school or at home? 

Absolutely，especially for Chinese children.
Fisrt，it's obviously that there are so many rules for children. They must follow the timetable and schedule.Like when to attend classes and performing duty on time.  Then, the children have regular examinations and tests.Those cause double pressure from life and peers.
And when the children back to home, they should compliance with internal family rules.These vary according to customs and habits in different countries and regions. For example,In some Western countries, the elder family members believe in Christianity and say grace before meals, while such practices are rare in China. However, due to traditional culture and etiquette, children are expected to behave properly at home, such as not putting their feet on the coffee table or sofa, which is a common scene in the American sitcom Friends.
In short, children have many rules to follow at both school and home.
